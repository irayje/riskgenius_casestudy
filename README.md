# Overview and Origin

* Name of company: RiskGenius 

* Parent company: ClaimKit

* Incorporated: 2015

* Founders: Chris Cheatham and Doug Reiser

## What is Risk Genius

RiskGenius is a company which provides software-based natural language processing tools for improving the quality and accuracy of insurance policies. The platform is used to support the integration of our insurance-specific algorithms and machine learning tools for policy automation and review for commercial insurance brokers and agents. The Platform incorporates Artificial Intelligence to structure, categorize and deliver policy data. 

* Comparison: Side-by-side comparison of policies and clauses 

* Manuscripts: A policy creation tool allowing users to drag and drop clauses from a library of pre-approved clauses

* Analytics: A tool to analyze all policy documents (e.g. language trends over time)

* Compliance: A tool for reviewing and approving proposed policy language across other teams (e.g. legal and compliance)


## How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

RiskGenius is a child of another product by co-founders of ClaimKit, Chris Cheatham and Doug Reiser. Their journey began as frustrated insurance attorneys before 2011. Unsatisfied with the messy insurance documentation, they came together to create and improve claim documents. The two created ClaimKit, a software and services offering to collect, organize and deliver claim documents to attorneys, consultants, accountants, and claim handlers. Through this process, Doug and Chris teamed up with Dan Burtchett to build document management software and Tyler Round to collect and process electronic data. 

While working a large claim in 2014, Chris was contacted by an underwriter wanting to access the ClaimKit software. After briefly reviewing documents, the underwriter called back to ask if the software could be used for policy analysis. The ClaimKit team began exploring what policy analysis entailed. In 2015, the team also worked on a pilot project to apply machine learning to a large library of insurance policies. The team eventually had the idea to connect the two — Policy Analysis software and Machine Learning — and RiskGenius was born. The RiskGenius software product was launched in early 2016, after a year and a half of development and feedback from Beta users. 

## How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

RiskGenius just completed their Series B round of funding on July 2019 led by Hudson Structured Capital Management Ltd. (Stamford, Conn.), d.b.a. HSCM Bermuda and expanded partnerships with three of the world’s largest insurance carriers, Everest Insurance (Warren, N.J./Hamilton, Bermuda), FM Global (Johnston, R.I.) and Liberty Mutual (Boston). The total amount was undisclosed but according to Crunchbase their estimated funding is to be around
$60.5M total before their Series B.

# Business Activities:

## What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Insurance claims use nuanced languages for different policies and everyone has their way of underwriting their insurances. RiskGenius is used for policy review to quickly and easily interpret, organize and standardize policy language. This saves manual interpretation of ways different brokers way of writing similar claims and contracts inherent to complex coverages. 

>Imagine you have an insurance policy from Carrier A and a proposal (or quote) from the same carrier. Often times (too often) there are discrepancies between what was quoted, what gets negotiated and what ends up in the final policy (most carriers have this issue). With our GeniusCheck software, I was able to identify that a form that was included in the proposal never made it to the bound policy. Identifying these types of errors can reduce errors and omissions exposure.

## What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

RiskGenius is one of the first content management systems that is solely focused on insurance policies. However, their main key advantage is that the use of machine language and artificial intelligence that is solely focused on insurance only. While other competitors focus on process flow of forms, insurance, and policies, RiskGenius also helps automate and refine insurance language and claims for wording, policy, competitor analysis. RiskGenius is utilizing machine learning to determine if it improves the regulatory reviews of an insurance company by standardizing languages and filings. 

The user experience first involves uploading insurance policies to the RiskGenius platform. Each policy is then parsed for cover type, policy term length and any coverage exclusions or conditions that may exist in the policy. Finally, policies are stored on a private cloud server for retrieval and review.


## Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

RiskGenius leverages both machine learning and natural language processing to parse and categorize policy terms to identify coverage gaps and potential opportunities to upsell additional coverage. Along with employing artificial intelligence to categorize seemingly disparate policy terms and conditions. Specifically, policy terms that form unstructured data sets are identified and clustered by the RiskGenius AI network, which continuously increases the accuracy and depth of its policy data parsing. This policy data is then stored, analyzed and easily reviewed by agents.
